# Database Repository

This repository contains SQL schemas for managing user-related data, including:

- User Alerts: Tracks alerts for slouching and prolonged sitting, including user ID, alert ID, alert type, timestamp, and alert status.
- User Logins: Stores user login details, including user ID, username, password (hashed), and email.
  
Additional database schemas may be added in the future to enhance functionality and support various user-related operations.
